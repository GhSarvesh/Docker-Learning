Perfect! Here's your **README with diagrams** (represented by placeholders) for **visual understanding**. You can later replace the placeholders with actual images or diagrams. If you want, I can also generate those images for you.

## 🧠 What is Virtualization?

**Virtualization** allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine using **virtual machines (VMs)**.

```
+--------------------+
| Physical Hardware  |
+--------------------+
|     Hypervisor     |
+--------------------+
|    VM 1  |   VM 2  |
|   OS+App |  OS+App |
+--------------------+
```

## 💻 What is a Hypervisor?

A **hypervisor** is software that creates and manages VMs.

### Types of Hypervisors:

| Type       | Description               | Example                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Type 1** | Runs directly on hardware | VMware ESXi, Hyper-V           |
| **Type 2** | Runs on host OS           | VirtualBox, VMware Workstation |

## 🧱 What is a Container?

A **container** is a lightweight, isolated environment for running apps. Unlike VMs, it shares the host's OS kernel.

```
+-----------------------------+
|       Host OS Kernel        |
+-----------------------------+
| Container 1 | Container 2   |
| App + Libs  | App + Libs    |
+-----------------------------+
```

✅ Faster
✅ Uses less memory
✅ Starts in seconds

## 🐳 What is Docker?

Docker is a **tool that automates the deployment of applications in containers**.

* Docker helps you:

  * Package your code + dependencies
  * Ship anywhere
  * Run consistently

## 🔄 Docker Lifecycle

1. **Dockerfile** – Define environment
2. **Image** – Built from Dockerfile
3. **Container** – Running instance of the image

### Lifecycle Diagram:

```
Dockerfile --> docker build --> Image --> docker run --> Container
                                               |
                                         docker stop/remove
```

## ⚙️ Common Docker Commands

| Command                 | Action                      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `docker build -t app .` | Build image from Dockerfile |
| `docker run app`        | Run a container             |
| `docker ps`             | List running containers     |
| `docker ps -a`          | List all containers         |
| `docker images`         | List all images             |
| `docker stop <id>`      | Stop a container            |
| `docker rm <id>`        | Remove a container          |
| `docker rmi <image>`    | Remove an image             |

## 📌 Why Containers over VMs?

| Feature        | Virtual Machine | Docker Container |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Size           | GBs             | MBs              |
| Boot Time      | Minutes         | Seconds          |
| OS             | Guest OS per VM | Shared Host OS   |
| Resource Usage | Heavy           | Light            |
